Put them into the same graph, 

analyze the autocorreleation graph, ,

gaussian fit of linear and non-linear spring

how to quantify the simulation?


new paper: statistical physics and mesoscopic modeling to interpret tethered particle motion experiments


find out if this approach is correct
(the persistence length)

look more on paper if they use the same appoarch

new paper: statistical physics and mesoscopic modeling to interpret tethered particle motion experiments
what type of simulation (sumary)


COmpare the auto correlation function: 
Read new paper to figure how they use experiment
